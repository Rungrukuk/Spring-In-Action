 The authorization server—An authorization server’s job is to obtain permission
from a user on behalf of a client application. If the user grants permission, then
the authorization server gives an access token to the client application that it
can use to gain authenticated access to an API.

 The resource server—A resource server is just another name for an API that is
secured by OAuth 2. Although the resource server is part of the API itself, for
the sake of discussion, the two are often treated as two distinct concepts. The
resource server restricts access to its resources unless the request provides a
valid access token with the necessary permission scope. For our purposes, the
Taco Cloud API we started in chapter 7 will serve as our resource server, once
we add a bit of security configuration to it.

 The client application—The client application is an application that wants to consume an API but needs permission to do so. We’ll build a simple administrative
application for Taco Cloud to be able to add new ingredients.

 The user—This is the human who uses the client application and grants the
application permission to access the resource server’s API on their behalf.
