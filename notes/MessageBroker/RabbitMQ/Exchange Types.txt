 Default—A special exchange that’s automatically created by the broker. It routes
messages to queues whose name is the same as the message’s routing key. All
queues will automatically be bound to the default exchange.

 Direct—Routes messages to a queue whose binding key is the same as the message’s routing key.

 Topic—Routes a message to one or more queues where the binding key (which
may contain wildcards) matches the message’s routing key.

 Fanout—Routes messages to all bound queues without regard for binding keys
or routing keys.

 Headers—Similar to a topic exchange, except that routing is based on message
header values rather than routing keys.

 Dead letter—A catchall for any messages that are undeliverable (meaning they
don’t match any defined exchange-to-queue binding).
