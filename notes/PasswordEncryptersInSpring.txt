Which password encoder should you use?
Not all password encoders are created equal. Ultimately, you’ll need to weigh each
password encoder’s algorithm against your security goals and decide for yourself. But
you should avoid a couple of password encoders for production applications.
NoOpPasswordEncoder applies no encryption whatsoever. Therefore, although it may
be useful for testing, it is unsuitable for production use. And StandardPasswordEncoder is not considered secure enough for password encryption and has, in fact,
been deprecated.
Instead, consider one of the other password encoders, any of which are more secure.
We’re going to use BCryptPasswordEncoder for the examples in this book.
