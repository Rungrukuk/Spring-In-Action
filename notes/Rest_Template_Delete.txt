public void deleteIngredient(Ingredient ingredient) {
 rest.delete("http://localhost:8080/ingredients/{id}",
 ingredient.getId());
}
In this example, only the URL (specified as a String) and a URL variable value are
given to delete(). But as with the other RestTemplate methods, the URL could be
specified as a URI object or the URL parameters given as a Map.
