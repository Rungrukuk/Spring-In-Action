Is JPA repository better version of import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository; ?

Yes, JpaRepository is indeed an extension of CrudRepository, and it provides additional functionality over CrudRepository. Both JpaRepository and CrudRepository are interfaces provided by Spring Data JPA to simplify the implementation of data access layers in Spring applications.

Here are the main differences between JpaRepository and CrudRepository:

Additional Query Methods: JpaRepository includes additional query methods like flush(), saveAndFlush(), deleteInBatch(), findAll(Sort), findAll(Pageable), and more.

Derived Query Methods: Both JpaRepository and CrudRepository support query methods derived from method names, but JpaRepository provides more powerful capabilities for defining custom query methods using method names.

Batch Operations: JpaRepository provides methods for batch operations like saveAll(), deleteAll(), etc.

Pagination and Sorting: JpaRepository includes built-in support for pagination and sorting using Pageable and Sort parameters in query methods.

In most cases, JpaRepository is preferred over CrudRepository because of its additional functionality, unless you have very basic CRUD requirements and don't need the extra features provided by JpaRepository.
