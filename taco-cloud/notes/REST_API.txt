$ curl "localhost:8080/data-api/tacos?sort=createdAt,desc&page=0&size=12"

Here the sort parameter specifies that you should sort by the createdDate property
and that it should be sorted in descending order (so that the newest tacos are first).
The page and size parameters specify that you should see the first page of 12 tacos.
